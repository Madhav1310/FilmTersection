# ðŸŽ¬ FilmTersection 

Welcome to the FilmTersection - the Common Movie Finder! This project stemmed from my fascination with movies and the constant struggle of finding a movie that all my friends and I can agree on watching. To solve this problem, I decided to create a flask based website that would help find a common movie recommendation based on multiple input movies. The tool uses a recursive algorithm that makes API calls to the TMDB (The Movie Database) API, searching for a movie that is common across all or most of the input movies.

<br>
<h2>The Algorithm</h2>

The FilmTersection algorithm works as follows:

	1.	Initial API Call: For each movie entered by the user, the tool makes an API call to TMDB to fetch the top 20 recommended movies.
	2.	Recursive Search: If no common movie is found across all input movies, the algorithm recursively makes API calls on the recommendations, expanding the search until a common movie is found or a predefined threshold is reached.
	3.	Best Alternative: If no common movie is found across all movies after reaching the threshold, the algorithm identifies the best alternativeâ€”a movie that is common across the maximum number of input movies.

<br>
<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

	â€¢	Python: Core language used for backend logic.
	â€¢	Flask: Lightweight web framework used to create the web application.
	â€¢	TMDB API: Used to fetch movie recommendations based on user input.
	â€¢	HTML/CSS: Used to build the front-end interface.
	â€¢	JavaScript: Handles dynamic loading screen functionality and form submission.
	â€¢	GitHub: Version control and project management.
